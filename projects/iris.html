      <h1>Project: NASA Lunabotics</h1>
      <p>
        As a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Illinois
        Urbana-Champaign, there are a ton of clubs where I am able to develop my
        technical and teamwork skills. However, my deep interest in robotics and
        automation lead me to IRIS.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Overview: NASA Lunabotics Competition</h2>

      <p>
        The NASA Lunabotics competition serves as a platform for aspiring
        engineers to showcase their skills in developing robotic systems capable
        of excavating lunar regolith â€“ a crucial task for future space
        exploration and habitation. My involvement with IRIS has been
        instrumental in shaping my understanding of complex robotics systems,
        honing my problem-solving skills, and fostering a collaborative spirit
        within a multidisciplinary team.
      </p>

      <h2>About the Robot:</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Mechanical:</strong> Mechanical designs and fabricates the
          entire robot. We work closely with the other subteams to validate
          space claims, as well as motor placement.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Electrical:</strong> The electrical team is responsible for
          the development of custom control boards and the electrical
          connections of the robot.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Autonomy:</strong> Autonomy develops the algorithms for SLAM
          using ROS. Theya re responsible for developing object detection and
          control of the drive system.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>My role:</h2>
      <p>
        I am responsible for the design and fabrication of the excavation system. I work closely with the Mechanical team lead and another member in my group to validate our designs.
