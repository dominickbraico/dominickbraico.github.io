        <p>For this project, I really wanted to 
            learn about real-world applications for 
            Robotics. The most common examply is that
             of a pick and palce robot used on a manufacturing 
             line. I first needed to start with a basic cad 
             model of a simple 6 DOF arm that I could then export as a 
             URDF file to run Gazebvo simulations with. I was already
              aware of a solidworks extension that could automate this
               process for me so all I had to do was create the model 
               and optimize it for URDF export. </p>

        <h2 class = "center">Step 2: Export to URDF</h2>
        <p>URDF (Universal Robotic Description Format) 
            is an XML-based file format used to describe 
            robot models in the context of robotics and simulation.
             It provides a standardized way to represent the 
             kinematics, dynamics, visual appearance, and other 
             properties of a robot. To create a URDF file from a SolidWorks model,
              I utilized a SolidWorks extension specifically designed 
              for exporting to URDF format. First, I created and 
              optimized a 3D CAD model of a 6 DOF robotic arm in 
              SolidWorks. Then, with the extension installed, I 
              initiated the export process. The extension 
              intelligently extracted the necessary information 
              from the SolidWorks model, including joint limits, 
              link geometries, and inertial properties. It also 
              generated the corresponding URDF tags and structure.
               This streamlined approach saved me valuable time and 
               effort, allowing me to focus on the actual design and 
               simulation aspects of the project.</p>
