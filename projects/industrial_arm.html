      <p>
        For this project, I really wanted to learn about real-world applications
        for Robotics. The most common examply is that of a pick and palce robot
        used on a manufacturing line. I first needed to start with a basic cad
        model of a simple 6 DOF arm that I could then export as a URDF file to
        run Gazebvo simulations with. I was already aware of a solidworks
        extension that could automate this process for me so all I had to do was
        create the model and optimize it for URDF export.

      <h2 class="center">Step 2: Export to URDF</h2>
      <p>
        URDF (Universal Robotic Description Format) is an XML-based file format
        used to describe robot models in the context of robotics and simulation.
        It provides a standardized way to represent the kinematics, dynamics,
        visual appearance, and other properties of a robot. To create a URDF
        file from a SolidWorks model, I utilized a SolidWorks extension
        specifically designed for exporting to URDF format. First, I created and
        optimized a 3D CAD model of a 6 DOF robotic arm in SolidWorks. Then,
        with the extension installed, I initiated the export process. The
        extension intelligently extracted the necessary information from the
        SolidWorks model, including joint limits, link geometries, and inertial
        properties. It also generated the corresponding URDF tags and structure.
        This streamlined approach saved me valuable time and effort, allowing me
        to focus on the actual design and simulation aspects of the project.
