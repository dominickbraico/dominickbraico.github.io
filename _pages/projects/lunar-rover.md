## Overview

This project involved designing and fabricating excavation mechanisms for a lunar rover competing in the NASA Artemis Challenge. The rover was designed to collect and transport BP-1 lunar regolith simulant, replicating the challenging conditions of lunar surface operations.

## Technical Details

**Skills Used:** SolidWorks, Mechanical Design, Aluminum Fabrication, System Integration, NASA Artemis Standards

### Design Requirements

- Collect and transport BP-1 lunar regolith simulant
- Operate reliably in simulated lunar surface conditions
- Meet NASA Artemis Challenge specifications
- Withstand mechanical stresses of excavation operations

### Key Contributions

- **Regolith Collection Mechanism**: Designed custom excavation system optimized for lunar regolith simulant properties
- **Structural Design**: Led design of Aluminum 6061-T6 structural components for motor and drivetrain mounting
- **System Integration**: Ensured compatibility between excavation, mobility, and electrical systems
- **Testing & Iteration**: Conducted extensive testing to validate performance and reliability

## Mechanical Design

The excavation mechanism incorporated:
- Custom bucket design optimized for regolith particle size and flow characteristics
- Actuated dumping mechanism for controlled material release
- Reinforced mounting structure to handle excavation loads
- Integrated encoder feedback for position control

### Materials & Fabrication

- **Primary Structure**: Aluminum 6061-T6 for high strength-to-weight ratio
- **Fabrication Methods**: CNC machining, welding, and precision assembly
- **Surface Treatment**: Anodizing for corrosion resistance

## Competition Performance

The rover successfully demonstrated:
- Effective regolith collection from lunar surface simulant
- Reliable transport of collected material
- Robust operation throughout competition events
- Compliance with all NASA Artemis Challenge requirements

## Engineering Challenges

- Designing for the abrasive nature of regolith simulant
- Optimizing mechanism geometry for efficient excavation
- Managing weight constraints while maintaining structural integrity
- Ensuring repeatability and reliability across multiple collection cycles

## Team Context

This project was completed as part of a multidisciplinary team effort, with coordination between mechanical, electrical, and software engineering subsystems to create a fully functional competition rover.
