<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a minor in Computer Science, graduating in May 2026. My work focuses on robotics, control systems, and embedded software development, with experience spanning field robotics, powertrain engineering, and autonomous systems.

I have worked as a Field Robotics Engineering Intern at the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory, where I designed rugged electronic control modules and custom sensor mounts for modular construction robots. I also interned at Whisper Aero, developing firmware for motor controllers and conducting dynamometer testing for high power density electric propulsion systems.

My technical expertise includes mechanical design (SolidWorks CSWA certified), embedded programming in C/C++ and Python, and robotics frameworks like ROS 2. I am passionate about the intersection of mechanical systems and software, particularly in control systems, sensor integration, and autonomous vehicle development.
