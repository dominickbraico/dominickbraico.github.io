<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a mechanical engineering and computer science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in robotics and autonomous manufacturing systems. Currently, I work at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Laboratory supporting the development of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for real-world applications.

My interests include control systems, sensor fusion, robotic manipulation, and autonomous navigation systems.
